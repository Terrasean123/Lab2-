                <h2><strong>Aims</strong></h2>
                This project-based unit focuses on 
                developing your skills to build web applications
                using web technologies. You'll work individually and in 
                teams to tackle real-world web development challenges, building
                proficiency in selecting and applying suitable tools and techniques.
                The unit also covers essential aspects of security, ethics,
                accessibility, and professional communication within web development.
                Guidance from an academic facilitator will support you in mastering
                both technical skills and collaborative project management 
                techniques to achieve these objectives.
